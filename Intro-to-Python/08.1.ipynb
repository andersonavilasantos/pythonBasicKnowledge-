    "The format of individual columns and rows will impact analysis performed on a dataset read into a pandas DataFrame. For example, you can’t perform mathematical calculations on a string (text formatted data). This might seem obvious, however sometimes numeric values are read into pandas as strings. In this situation, when you then try to perform calculations on the string-formatted numeric data, you get an error."

    "### Types of Data\n",
    "How information is stored in a DataFrame or a Python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we will explore in this lesson: numeric and text data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numeric Data Types\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A floating point (known as a float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For example: 1.13, 2.0, 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and floating point numbers, pandas will assign the entire column to the float data type so the decimal points are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer will never have a decimal point. Thus if we wanted to store 1.13 as an integer it would be stored as 1. Similarly, 1234.345 would be stored as 1234. You will often see the data type Int64 in pandas which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64 refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can store in each “cell”. Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Data Type\n",
    "The text data type is known as a string in Python, or object in pandas. Strings can contain numbers and / or characters. For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. A pandas object might also be a plot name like 'plot1'. A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, '1234' could be stored as a string, as could '10.23'. However strings that contain numbers can not be used for mathematical operations!\n",
